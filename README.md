# Multi-Class Classification using Iris dataset

This is a Python project for Classification of Iris species into `Setosa`, `Versicolor` and `Virginica`.


## Motivation
I started this project as a motivation to learn about different Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms.
## Data Collection
- The dataset is collected from Kaggle.
- This dataset consists of 3 categories of species which is setosa, versicolor and virginica.
- We can find the Iris dataset in .csv file
- Each iris species consists of 50 samples.
- The features of iris flower are Sepal Length in cm, Sepal Width in cm, Petal Length in cm and Petal Width in cm.
## Dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
 The model achieved **76.85%** accuracy on **training data** and an accuracy of **97.78%** on **test data**.
